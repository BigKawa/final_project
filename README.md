### **Project Description**:
This **Automated Financial Report Analysis** project aims to simplify and enhance the process of analyzing financial statements by utilizing data from multiple years of financial reports. I use data sourced from the **Alpha Vantage API**, focusing on key financial metrics such as **Gross Margin**, **Operating Margin**, **Net Profit Margin**, and **Interest Coverage Ratio**. These KPIs are then evaluated using a rule book to generate automated insights in a narrative style, providing a comprehensive summary of the company's financial performance over time.

These KPIs are then evaluated using a rule book to generate automated insights in a narrative style, providing a comprehensive summary of the company's financial performance over time.

The insights are stored as a new column in the data, which makes it easy to visualize and understand the company's financial health at a glance. My ultimate goal is to create a solution that allows for a more intuitive, automated interpretation of financial data, which can be utilized in **financial reporting** and **dashboards** for stakeholders who require easy-to-understand insights.

For data retrieval, we are using **Alpha Vantage**, which provides real-time and historical data for various financial instruments, making it a valuable source for building the foundation of this project.

### **10-Day Plan (My Plan for the Next 10 Days)**:

1. **Day 1-2**: I will complete **Data Wranglig** to prepare data for automated insights
2. **Day 3-4**: I will refine the **automated insights generation** function to include more in-depth interpretations, add comparisons to industry standards, and perform year-over-year analysis.
3. **Day 5**: I will develop **visualizations** using Tableau to represent key metrics over time and incorporate dynamic tooltips with narrative insights.
4. **Day 6-7**: I will start building a **financial dashboard** that will allow stakeholders to explore the companyâ€™s financial health interactively.
5. **Day 8 (optional)**: I will implement **predictive analytics** using regression models to forecast financial metrics, such as revenue, based on historical data.
6. **Day 9**: I will focus on **testing** the dashboard for usability, validating data accuracy, and refining the design for stakeholder presentation.
7. **Day 10**: **I will **prepare final documentation** and presentation. I will finalize the **README file**, summary reports, and complete the setup of any deliverables (e.g., reports or dashboards)..
