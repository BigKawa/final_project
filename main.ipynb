The Capital Expenditure Ratio was **3.72** (classified as **low**), suggesting the company is retaining a substantial portion of its operating cash flow, which could imply a conservative stance toward capital reinvestment. The Operating Cash Flow Growth was **26.48%**, classified as **high growth**, indicating significant improvement in cash generation over the past year, which reflects well on the company's operational efficiency. The Dividend Payout Ratio was **0.22** (classified as **low**), suggesting that the company retains a large portion of its cash flow for reinvestment and growth.
